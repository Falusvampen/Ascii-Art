Command format:
    go run . <text> --color=<input>

Color formats:
    --color=green:2-5 (numbers)
    --color=blue:abc (letters)
    --color=yellow:1-2,red:abc (multiple)

Command examples:
    go run . "Hello world!" --color=green:1-4
    // Hell in hello becomes green

Problems:
    - Color bleeds through to positions with shared numbers
        If there are 10 characters and number 1 is included in the range, character on position 10 will be colored as well
